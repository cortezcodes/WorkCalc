# Welcome to WorkCalc - The Work Logging tool

I built this application to track your daily accomplishment. By completing the daily logs you will be able to track how many hours to charge to a given budget, analyze and reflect on the days events, and keep track of your yearly accomplishments. 

Future development aims to add analytics to gain better insight into where all your hardwork is going week by week, month by month, and year by year

# Requirements
Python 3.11 or newer
pip
all other requirements can be installed by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Recommend installing from in a python virtual environment.

# create an executable file. 
run 'pyinstaller --onefile --name WorkCalc main.py'
This will produce two folders - build and dist. The executable will be in dist as WorkCalc.<OS_executable_file_extention>
